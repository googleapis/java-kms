About Google Cloud Cloud KMS
----------------------------

Google [Cloud KMS API][cloud-kms] lets you manage encryption for your cloud services the same way you do on-premises.

See the [Cloud KMS client library docs][kms-client-lib-docs] to learn how to use this Cloud KMS API Client Library.

Getting Started

[Follow these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) to get your project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by [installing the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and running the following commands in command line: `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

#### Installation and setup
You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-kms` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section to add `google-cloud-kms` as a dependency in your code.

#### Examples
